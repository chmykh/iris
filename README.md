Iris Gameplay Tweaks
====================

Tweaks for the "..:: Surreal Hardcore ::.. // oldschool tycoon" multiplayer server.

Version 1.

Aircrafts
---------

1. Modern helicopter never expires.
2. Removed all but 1 silly "futuristic" airplanes.
3. "Large/Small Airplane" flag tuned accordingly to the visual appearence; it affects game logic (safely landing on small airports).
4. Early turboprop plane sprites returned later as a small but cheap "airtaxi".
5. Total number of aircrafts reduced (22 vs 34).
6. Futuristic "hyperdart" slowered to normal plane speed but becomes a heli.

Trains
------

1. Modern passenger diesel train (Flirt), currently reusing monoral engine sprite.
2. 2 modern high-speed electric trains (newer TGV and newer Eurostar).
3. Monorail engines weakened significantly.
